- 👋 Hi, I’m @NekroticChaos
- 👀 I’m interested in theoretical chemistry, physicochemistry, analytical chemistry and data analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in Simon Bolivar University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in as many scientific projects as it takes, to help all of us understand the universe we live in (and perhaps some others). 
- 📫 My actual mail is: 15-11532@usb.ve
